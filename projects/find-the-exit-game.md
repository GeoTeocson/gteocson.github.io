Timmy Finds The Exit was a project which used a pre-existing board given to use by our professor. Our task was to implement the game itself. The board itself resembles minefield where the depending on your position there is a number showing how much mines you are next to. The main goal of the game is to get through to the other side.
A secondary goal is getting a better score by traversing more spaces and flagging where the bombs are.
