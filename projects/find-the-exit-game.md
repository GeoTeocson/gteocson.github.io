summary: "A game that was in EE160 about the player trying to traverse a minefield."
---

Timmy Finds The Exit was a project which used a pre-existing interface given to use by our professor. Our task was to implement the game itself. The board itself resembles minefield where the depending on your position there is a number showing how much mines you are next to. The main goal of the game is to get through to the other side.

To start the game, you first must choose your difficulty which changes the number of mines present in the field. Playing the game is played with using the keys around the j key. The lowercase keys (y,u,i,h,k,b,n,m) are used for movement. While inputting the uppercase keys (Y,U,I,H,K,B,N,M) places a flag down. Remember you only have a limited number of flags. Eventually you will either hit the bomb and lose or pass to the right side of the board and win.
