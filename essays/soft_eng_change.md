#Interests / Future / Skills

In terms of software engineering I would say I am open to most branches. Though I am sure with how diverse the field is there is something I am bound to not enjoy as much.
Recently, I would say I have had an increased interest in web development. Two of my close computer science friends, through class or internships, had enough knowledge to want to make
a website by themselves. They approached me to join even though I had no experience in anything related to web development. I was skeptical at first since it seemed extremely hard.
Slowly though any challenge I thought would slow the project down was met with "Oh yeah that's easy just add this or use this." Even with my limited knowledge my confidence 
in being able to do this by myself in the future grew.
