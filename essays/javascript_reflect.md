# The Easiest First Steps?

Before this course the only prior experience I had with javascript was when I was doing some coding problems with my friend. He knew javascript from his internship 
and was telling me how much better it is then C#, which was the only language I knew at the time. However, before I even attempted to learn javascript I had to learn about python for one of my capstone courses. It was great since I felt like I had more freedom in coding, no more brackets or semicolons and arrays were piece of cake. Though I still missed the feel of C# and still felt a lot more comfortable with it. Once I learned javascript it felt like the perfect blend between the two languages. The feel of C# with so many quality of life improvements made me enjoy the language from the start.

# A Different Way To Practice (FIX)

Even though I have barely started ICS 314 I cannot deny that having such a constant amount of practice problems and mandatory tutorials have beeng a great way to practice. (FIX) Most of my courses either had few hands on examples with a a focus on lecturing or the coding problems tended to be a set piece of code and creating a function. If you are like me that may not be your most preferred method. 

# Not Everything Can Be Easy

Now there still is a lot of challenges I face considering I have only used this language for a little over a week. Remember how I said there were nice QOL improvements, there are a decent amount of them. As an introduction we were required to work on the JavaScript Introduction and ES6 module on the freecodecamp website. Now I am not master at C# and there may be some stuff I learned in the modules that may be able to be done in C#. That being said destructuring, passing functions as arguments, promises, arrow functions, and many more are all extremely new. Yet I love the challenge and hopefully utilizing the strategies I learned I could become more efficient in not only JavaScript but C#, Python and any other language I will learn as well.
