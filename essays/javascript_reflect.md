#Start of my journey

The only prior experience I had with javascript was when I was doing some coding problems with my friend. He knew javascript from his internship 
and was telling me how much better it is then C#, which was the only language I knew at the time. Eventually for one of my classes I got to learn about python
and thought to myself how much easier it was. When I was first learning about javascript it seemed to be a great in between of both the languages. It kept the same feel 
from C# but had so much quality of life improvements that python had.

#Why is javascript so good?

Coding language is a preference, so why should I believe you?

Now do not get me wrong, there are so many different programming languages that are used for different things. I am more so trying to give you my background and a real life review from an active yet relatively beginner coder. 

#Is practice everything?

Even though I have barely started ICS 314 I cannot deny that the way we practiced was one of the best. (FIX) Most of my courses either had few hands on examples with a a focus on lecturing or the coding problems tended to be a set piece of code and creating a function. If you are like me that may not be your most preferred method.
