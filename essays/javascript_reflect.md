#Start of my journey

The only prior experience I had with javascript was when I was doing some coding problems with my friend. He knew javascript from his internship 
and was telling me how much better it is then C#, which was the only language I knew at the time. Eventually for one of my classes I got to learn about python
and thought to myself how much easier it was. When I was first learning about javascript it seemed to be a great in between of both the languages. It kept the same feel 
from C# but had so much quality of life improvements that python had.

#Why is javascript so good?

Coding language is a preference, so why should I believe you?

#Is practice everything?

#Callback
